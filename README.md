# Yet Another Fetch

A quick and simple Fetch program written in C.

Likely general structure:
OS
Kernel
Uptime
CPU
GPU
RAM information
Disk Space??

Anything else will come from later inspiration.

# TODO
1. Make a picture setter
2. Documentation through cli
3. Clean code/smash bugs
4. Consistency in variables
